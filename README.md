In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Brief overview of the architecture.
App.js-is the main class that connects all the components and displays the on the UI also fetch data from the API and pass it to other components
App.css its responsible for styling the whole CSS
Icons folder has all components used in the code
It has additional five Componets:
Details.js(InfoBox) contails a all the details about the products and quality of the item.
Count.js it used in the Details.js to countdown the time left until the discount is invalid
OptionQTY.js is for the Quality of the products how many options are you willing to add.
Header.js is for accessing the picture of the item
Ship.js it shows the shipping price and shipping locations and time it will take.



## Short summary of your choice of technology stack - why did you choose it and if you were to do it again, would you change anything.

I decided to use react instead of plain java script with react i can create components that i can
reuse or call in different functons it makes it efficient and easy to uderstand the code.React
uses Virtual Dom it makes it faster to load when changes are made unline real Dom.
React its easier to maintain and handles Ui and logic together.

# Changes ill make given this assesment again

I will start by creating components and adding the css after that will make it effiency and 
less of the code unlike adding a feature the style it immediately like i did i could not track
other components/features that share same styling.

I will also futher break down the Details.js components into smaller components it much messier
than i thought it will be. create min and max components for fetching the lowest and highest price.
It will be more cleaner and easy to read and also do functionality i could not do.
